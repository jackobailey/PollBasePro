#' Is a Constituency in the "Red Wall"?
#'
#' This function takes a vector of constituency names and returns a variable that indicates if each element is in the "Red Wall" or not. These constituencies are coded according to the classification created by James Kanagasooriam that underpinned much of the Conservative's 2019 campaign.
#'
#' @param x A vector of constituency data.
#' @return A boolean vector.
#' @examples
#' \dontrun{
#' is_redwall(x = "Bury South")
#' }
#' @export

is_red_wall <- function(x = NULL){

  # Check if x is in list of redwall seats

  rw <- x %in% c(britpol::red_wall$name, britpol::red_wall$gss_code)

  # Return the data to the user

  return(rw)
