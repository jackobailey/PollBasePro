#' Simplify British Political Party Names
#'
#' For a majoritarian democracy, Britain has quite a few parties. Further, some of the main parties come in more than one variant (e.g. Labour & Co-op). This function takes a vector of party names, simplifies them, and then returns them to the user. It also includes some useful options to customise the output.
#'
#' @param x A vector of party names.
#' @param party_names A list of regular expressions to detect for each party, followed by the name to give the party. Note, the function converts all text to lower-case and removes any whitespace prior to simplification. E.g. list("^con|^tor" = "Conservative", "^lab" = "Labour).
#' @param nat Include nationalist parties or mark them as "Other"? Defaults to TRUE and includes them by default.
#' @param drop_dk Mark "Don't know", "Refused", etc. as missing? Defaults to TRUE.
#' @return A vector of party names.
#' @examples
#' simplify_party_names(c("Labour", "Lab", "Lib", "Conservatives", "Tories"))
#' @export
