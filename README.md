`{britpol}` is an `R` package that makes analysing British political
data quick and simple. It contains two pre-formatted datasets, plus a
host of useful functions. The first dataset, `pollbase`, is a
long-format version of Mark Pack’s dataset of historic British public
opinion polls combined with more recent data from Wikipedia. The second
dataset, `pollbasepro`, provides 24,038 daily estimates of voting
intention figures for each of Britain’s three largest parties between 26
May 1955 and 17 March 2021. [Stata and SPSS versions of the data are
available
too](https://github.com/jackobailey/britpol/tree/master/download).

To install the latest version of `{britpol}`, run the following code in
`R`:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jackobailey/britpol")
```

**British Poll of Polls, 17 March 2021:**

-   **Conservative Party:** 41% (38% to 44%)
-   **Labour Party:** 37% (34% to 40%)
-   **Liberal Democrats:** 9% (7% to 10%)

As of 17 March 2021, `pollbasepro` suggests that the Conservative Party
is the largest party in Britain. They hold a lead over the Labour Party
of 5% (95% CI: 1% to 8%). This puts the Labour Party in second place and
the Liberal Democrats in third place.

## Notes, Usage, and Attribution

`{britpol}`, `pollbase`, and `pollbasepro` will change over time as
elections come and go. Users should use only the most recent version of
the package when conducting their analyses. Like any project, some minor
mistakes might have crept into the code. If you think that you have
found an error or would like to make a recommendation for a future
update, please [raise an
issue](https://github.com/jackobailey/britpol/issues).

You may also use the `{britpol}` codebase for your own purposes in line
