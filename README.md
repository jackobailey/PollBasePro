The `{britpol}` package makes analysing British political data quick and
simple. It contains two pre-formatted datasets, plus a host of useful
functions. The first dataset, `pollbase`, is a long-format version of
Mark Pack’s dataset of historic British public opinion polls combined
with more recent data from Wikipedia. The second, `pollbasepro`,
provides 24,123 daily estimates of voting intention figures for each of
Britain’s three largest parties from 26 May 1955 to 10 June 2021.

To install the latest version of `{britpol}`, run the following code in
`R`:

``` r
devtools::install_github("jackobailey/britpol")
```

## Latest Polling Estimates from PollBasePro

**British Poll of Polls, 10 June 2021:**

-   **Conservative Party:** 42% (39% to 45%)
-   **Labour Party:** 35% (32% to 37%)
-   **Liberal Democrats:** 9% (8% to 11%)

`pollbasepro` suggests that the Conservative Party is the largest party
in Britain. They hold a lead over the Labour Party of around 7% (4% to
11%). This puts the Labour Party in second and the Liberal Democrats in
third.

## Notes, Usage, and Attribution

`{britpol}`, `pollbase`, and `pollbasepro` will change over time as
elections come and go. Users should use only the most recent version of
the package when conducting their analyses. Like any project, some minor
mistakes might have crept into the code. If you think that you have
found an error or would like to make a recommendation for a future
update, please [raise an
