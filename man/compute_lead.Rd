\description{
We often want to know how much further one party is ahead of another in the polls. But this can be tricky when the polls contain error. This function takes a dataset with columns named "{{party}}_est" and "{{party}}_err", computes the lead of one party over another, and appends it plus the error in the estimate to the data.
